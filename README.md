# aiffel_exploration

Repository containing projects on Aiffel course.  
'ipynb' files starting with **[E_N_(number)_]Project** would show the way I think and tackle first-met projects like these.  
You will be able to see detailed reviews I came across during the implementation at the end of the notebook, and hopefully they will demonstrate my earnest attitude for ML/DL tasks as a beginner :)
